*** ESCAPE ROOM SOLUTIONS ***

To escape this room, you must hear the Vinyl Player in front of you, it will say "The recipe for happiness is a chicken parmigiana. For more hints call 9112", so you can read the "RECIPES" book that's on the bookcase. In its last page you will find a key and a battery.

You must use this key to open the box that's over the table near the window. It has a Simon game that shows a color sequence. Go to the door, insert the battery in the battery slot, then press the colored buttons following the Simon's sequence. This will energize the door lock. Its password is 9112.
